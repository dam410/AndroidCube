# Cube for Android
This small app is mainly a test app, to see how C++, SFML, OpenGL ES and
Android work together.

It is a cube, that you can rotate by moving the finger on the screen.

# Installation
First, you'll need to install Android tools and SFML for Android. Instructions
are given
[here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Tutorial:-Building-SFML-for-Android).

Then, simply typing `make` at the root of the repository should compile it.

If the developper's mode is enabled on your device, typing `make deploy` should
push the application to your device.
